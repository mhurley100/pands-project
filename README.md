# Programming and Scripting Project Set 2019

This repository is the submission for the 2019 project for the Programming and Scripting Module @ GMIT.

[Project set is located:] (https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-pands/raw/master/project.pdf)
      
## To download this repository:

1. Go to GitHub
2. Go to my repository [https://github.com/mhurley100/pands-project.git]
3. Click the Clone or download button

## How to run the code:

1. Python is required to run the programs
2. Using the Command Line interface execute each program

## The problem set contains the following:

1. Readme.md

## Research
The data set records 3 classes of iris.  50 Iris's are logged for species and dimensions 
(length and width) of its sepal and petal measurements in centimetres.
The Iris flowers were taken from the same location, measured by the same person, 
and with the same instrument.

Petals — the usually brightly coloured parts that together form most of a flower
Sepals — one of the outer part that surround the petals (usually small and green)


Investigate:

1. Is there a correlation between sepal width and length?

2. Can an Iris species be identified by its dimension?

Iris-1.py separates the Iris flowers into their respective classes.  
Using pandas dataframe describe to analyse each data set.
Use graphics to understand the data by visualising and summarising.

The box and whisper plots demonstrate that distributions are relatively even

Histograms point out the diffences in the distributions

Scattergraph looks at the relationship between the attributes
3. Data Set Analysis

3. Summary of investigation
4. Supporting tables and graphics
