## Introduction

Edgar Anderson collected data on 3 different Iris species on the Gaspe Peninsula, Quebec, Canada.
Two of the three species were collected "all from the same pasture and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".[1] 
The data set comprises 50 samples from each of three species of Iris:
1. Iris Setosa
2. Iris Virginica
3. Iris Versicolor

Four features are were measured from each sample:
1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm) 

Ronald A. Fischer (British statistician and biologist) used Andersonâ€™s data and formulated linear discriminant analysis using the Iris dataset in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". The goal of discriminant analysis is given four measurements a flower can be classified correctly. Data analytics has evolved significantly since Fischer's paper with the Iris dataset used for training and testing of algorithms and Machine Learning.  It appears possible that with multivariate samples outcomes can be predicted with very high levels of accuracy.

## Dataset Analysis

Observations of the dataset:
- It is small - only 150 rows and 4 features.
- It appears straightforward with no data missing.

#### Statistics
Iris-1.py is a python program that calculates basic statistics on the dataset.  The Iris raw data is imported into python as a csv file.  
There are so many online sources, however many sites have the same repeated analysis.  Machinelearningmastery.com [2] and kaggle.com [4] were used as learning resources and training tools for Iris-1.py. The Iris data set can be downloaded from multiple libraries.  I chose to save as a csv file within this repository. I also imported tabulate by running "tabulate" on the command line interface.  I researched how to formulate a table in python and import into github using (itbucket.org [14] & pypi.org/project/tabulate [13])  The result of this research is as follows:

 Anaconda's Pandas is the tool of choice for statistical analysis.  It is very powerful as it manipulates, analyses and performs statistical analysis with minimal coding.  Iris-1.py contains pandas python programs to group the Iris flowers into their respective classes (Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica) and separate by dimensions (petal width, petal length, sepal width and sepal length).  Pandas dataframe describe() was used to perform this analysis.  Below are the programs used to analyse the dataset:

1.  The first 20 lines are printed by running the following line of code on the dataset:
    -(print(dataset.head(20)))
2.  The dataset is printed, grouped by class (species) and sample size using the following code:
    -print(dataset.groupby('class').size())
3.  3 dataframes are created for each species ('class') of Iris and each named as their respective species using the following code:
    - e.g.setosa is separated into its class as follows: dataset[dataset['class']=='Iris-setosa']. 
4.  Pandas dataframe describe() calculates statistics on the dataset.  Each class of Iris is grouped and statistics are completed (count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max) for each class of Iris using tabulate (this enables the data to be pasted into github layout) as follows:
    -print(tabulate(setosa.describe(), headers,tablefmt="github"))

#### Univariate Plots
Univariate plots help understand each variable independently by analysing interactions between variables.  There is a wide array of plotting resources available online from historgrams, bar charts, scatter graphs, box, violin, linear etc. all producing similar results.  I chose box plots and violin plots.  Box plots summarise data within and between groups using the 25th, 50th & 75th percentiles which means that they are not influenced by outliers.  Violin plots show the probability distribution of the sample by computing empirical distributions using kernal density estimation (KDE) (source matplotlib.org[8]).  I used Seaborn as it has the added advantage of colour and sizing options.    

Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and csv libraries are required to run the programs for Iris 1.1.py where the four variables of petal length, petal width, sepal length and petal width are explored using box and violin plots.  Machinelearningmastery.com [2], tutorialspoint.com [7], seaborn.pydata.org [9], stackoverflow.com[5] and python.org [6]were used as learning resources and training tools.  Below are the programs used to analyse the dataset:

1.  Box plot for each variable (petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width) are displayed using the following code (e.g sepal length) with the relevant heading included:
    - sns.boxplot(x="class", y="sepal length", data=dataset).set_title('Compare Sepal Length Distribution')
2. Violin plot for each variable (petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width) are displayed using the following code (e.g sepal length) with the relevant heading included:
    - sns.violinplot(x="class", y="sepal length", data=dataset, size=6).set_title('Compare Sepal Length Distribution')
3.  Show the plot.  The box plot is displayed using the following code:
    - plt.show()

The box plots have vertical lines extending from the boxes. These vertical lines indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles.

Violin plots display density of the data.  Using violin plots, Setosa stands out due to its density across all 4 variables.  This makes it relatively easy to identify.

#### Multivariate Plots
Pairplots were used to analyse the relationship between each variable and also explain the relationship between variables.  
Machinelearningmastery.com [2], www.kaggle.com [4], stackoverflow.com[5] seaborn.pydata.org [9], learn4master.com [12] and python.org [6] were used as learning resources and training tools for Iris-2.py. and Iris-3.py.  

In the command line interface run Iris-2.py & Iris-3.py.  Seaborn pairplot is used to graphically compare the distribution of each dimension and their relationship to other dimensions.

Below are the programs used to analyse the dataset:
1.  3 dataframes are created for each species ('class') of Iris and each named as their respective species using the following code:
    - e.g.setosa - dataset[dataset['class']=='Iris-setosa']. 
2.  Pair plots for petal length, petal width, sepal length and petal width sepal length are displayed using the following code (e.g sepal length):
    - g = sns.pairplot(dataset, hue='class', markers=["o", "s", "D"])
3.  Use seaborn pairgrid functionality on the dataset:
g = sns.PairGrid(dataset, hue="class", palette="Set2", hue_kws={"marker": ["o", "s", "D"]})
Generate scatter plot using seaborn:
g = g.map(plt.scatter, linewidths=1, edgecolor="w", s=40)
4.  Show the plot.  The box plot is displayed using the following code:
    plt.show()

![Seaborn1_Distribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47399526/56510680-6b008380-6522-11e9-8319-2c838b5ff75c.PNG)
In the command line interface run Iris-3.py.

This graphs a scatterplot for each pairwise relationship.  Again Setosa is very clearly distinguishable.  Versicolor and Virginica less so but should still be identifiable to a given acceptable range.

#### Dataset Summary:
Using statistical analysis the standard deviation for all three species of Iris is low therefore the results indicate that the data samples are reasonably close to the mean and as a result potentially predictable.
- Petal width stands out as an identifier for Iris class.  
- Petal width observations:
  - Iris-Virginica has the widest petals.  1.4 - 2.5 (1.8 to 2.5 is always Virginica)
  - Iris-Versicolor has medium width petals. 1.0 - 1.8 is always Versicolor
  - Iris-Setosa has the narrowest petals - 0.1 - 0.6 cm meaning Setosa can be identified using petal width as the key parameter.

Using univariate analysis, Setosa stands out from Virginica and Versicolor.  Setosa is easily identifiable by petal width (in particular) and petal length as the data is closely grouped.  Virginica and Versicolor appear more closely related to each other.
Both violin and box plots display (similar to the tables above) that petal width is the key identifier and Setosa is different from the other 2 species.  

Using multivariate analysis, Iris-Setosa stands out as being easy to classify given the 4 dimensions.
- 2 scatter plots clearly demonstrate the correlation between sepal width and length and petal width and length for each class of Iris.  From the scatter matrix you can see that Iris Setosa is almost completely identifiable based on sepal width and length and petal width and length.  
- Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica are more alike as there is an overlap in sepal width and length but are more identifiable by petal width and length. 

The Iris dataset is relatively small and predictable therefore statistical analysis would be sufficent to draw conclusions regarding the data set.  However multivariate plotting adds a new dimension and is a step above tables and univariate analysis.  It enables visualisation of the relationship between the variables which would aid analysis of inter-relationship of variables in more complex datasets.

### Machine learning
Is it possible to classify and predict species of Iris (Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica) with 4 given dimensions (sepal width, sepal length, petal width and petal length)? Can classes can be predicted given multiple parameters?  With that purpose in mind, machine learning techniques were researched using scikit-learn.org, machinelearningmastery.com, kaggle.com and quantinsti.com

Machine Learning provides machines with the ability to learn autonomously based on observations and analysing patterns without explicitly programming.  With a program, a definite set of instructions are writted for the machine to follow. With machine learning, patterns are identified and analysed in the dataset and decisions are taken autonomously based on observations and learnings from the dataset.

Machine Learning algorithms are broadly classified into Supervised Algorithms and Unsupervised Algorithms.  KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) appears to be the classification algorithm of choice (Supervised Algorithm) for assigning a class to new data points. The main advantage of KNN is that it does not make any assumptions on the data distribution. It keeps all the training data to make future predictions by computing the similarity between an input sample and each training instance.

A common practice in machine learning is to evaluate an algorithm by splitting a data set in two - one being the training set (properties are learned) and the other the testing set (to test the learned properties) [10] scikit-learn.org.

Python program Iris-4.py (program adapted from machinelearningmastery.com[2]) is used to analyse the dataset:  

Pandas, pandas plotting, matplotlib, csv and several sklearn libraries are imported.  
1.  Iris Dataset is defined as an array with the below code (converts list by calling the array() function)
array = dataset.values
2. X & Y arrays are sliced:
X = array[:,0:4], Y = array[:,4]
3.  Use 20% of dataset for testing:  validation_size = 0.20
3. Each seed value will correspond to a sequence of generated values for a given random number generator:  seed = 7
4.  Training data is in X_train and Y_train for model training and X_validation and Y_validation for later use with the below code:
X_train, X_validation, Y_train, Y_validation = model_selection.train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=validation_size, random_state=seed)
Print the accuracy score:  print(accuracy_score(Y_validation, predictions))
Print confusion matrix: print(confusion_matrix(Y_validation, predictions))
Print classification report: print(classification_report(Y_validation, predictions))

The accuracy is 0.9 or 90%. The confusion matrix provides an indication of the three errors made. Finally, the classification report provides a breakdown of each class by precision, recall, f1-score and support showing excellent results (given the validation dataset was small).

6. Predict Iris class or species:
knn = neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)
knn.fit(X, y)
7. Predict Iris Species (4cm x 4cm sepal and 4cm x 2cm petal)
print(iris.target_names[knn.predict([[3, 5, 3, 3]])])

|               |precision   | recall   |f1-score |support
|---------------|------------|----------|---------|-------|
|Iris-setosa    |1.00        | 1.00     |1.00     | 7     |
|Iris-versicolor|   0.85     | 0.92     | 0.88    | 12    |
|Iris-virginica | 0.90       |0.82      |0.86     | 11    |
|               |            |          |         |       |
|micro avg      | 0.90       | 0.90     |0.90     | 30    |
|macro avg      | 0.92       |0.91      |0.91     |30     |
|weighted avg   |  0.90      |0.90      |0.90     |30     |

##### Machine Learning Summary
Machine learning techniques aid validation of the dataset and estimate accuracy. It involves learning properties of a data set and then testing those properties against another data set. Each instance describes the properties of an observed flower measurements and the output variable is specific iris species.  KNN can be used for predicting class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its nearest K neighbours.  This value is the average (or median) of the values of its k nearest neighbours.  Accuracy is 90% which gives high confidence.  This is a step change in data analytics, machine learning can predict outcomes.  The confusion matrix provides an indication of the three errors made. Finally, the classification report provides a breakdown of each class by precision, recall, f1-score and support showing excellent results (granted the validation dataset was small).
KNN can predict an Iris class if data on the 4 variables with the data provided.

### Insights and Comparative Analysis
Data analytics has evolved with the advent of technology and analytical tools that can predict outcomes with high levels of accuracy. However, the Iris dataset can be analysed almost as effectively with only one variable - petal width. Using multiple variables makes simple analysis more difficult to explain and critique.  Also, it has been established that a variety of classification methods yield good results on Iris however Iris is predictable and relatively easy to classify.  

Data analysis on a dataset is only as good as the raw data input.  Versicolor and Virginica are so alike - should additional samples have been taken to further improve and enhance the result instead of applying complex machine learning models to try to predict classification?  It may be that there are issues with the underlying data.  Two of the three samples were picked on the same day - this is a qualitative variable which is not factored into any of the analytical tools.  Also what growth stage were these flowers at?


### Conclusion

This project examines statistical, univariate, multivariate and machine learning capabilities.
However the results are only as good as the quality of the data used.
There are relatively few features in the Iris dataset and two of the classes are much more correlated than the third.  Setosa is very easily separated by the petal width and petal length. Therefore, data modelling lends itself in this case to good results.  We can predict Setosa with almost 100% accuracy given known data points.

In Machine Learning, there is no specific model or an algorithm which can give 100% result to every single dataset. We need to understand the data before we apply any algorithm and build our model depending on the desired result. 

More basic modelling is sufficient as the Iris dataset is predictable.  However, machine learning has undoubted benefits given complexity.
