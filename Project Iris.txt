Research of data set:

Data Set Information:

The data set records 3 classes of iris.  50 Iris's are logged for species and dimensions 
(length and width) of its sepal and petal measurements in centimetres.
The Iris flowers were taken from the same location, measured by the same person, 
and with the same instrument.

Petals — the usually brightly coloured parts that together form most of a flower
Sepals — one of the outer part that surround the petals (usually small and green)


Investigate:

Is there a correlation between sepal width and length?

Can an Iris species be identified by its dimension?
